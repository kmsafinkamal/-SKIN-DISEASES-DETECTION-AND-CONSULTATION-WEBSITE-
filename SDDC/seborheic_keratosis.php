            <p class="lead my-3">Seborrheic keratoses are epidermal skin tumors that commonly present in adult and elderly patients. 
                They are benign skin lesions and often do not require treatment. 
                However, it is essential to be able to differentiate these lesions from other benign and malignant skin tumors.</p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Seborrheic keratosis, a common and benign skin growth, typically emerges in middle-aged or older adults. These growths present as raised, 
                    wart-like lesions with variations in color, ranging from brown to black or even white. They often exhibit a waxy or scaly texture and can 
                    vary in size, appearing on sun-exposed areas like the face, chest, shoulders, and back. While seborrheic keratoses are generally harmless and 
                    painless, any changes in appearance, irritation, itching, or bleeding should prompt consultation with a dermatologist for proper evaluation.</p>

                
                <h2>Reasons</h2>
                <p>Seborrheic keratosis is influenced by genetic factors, with evidence of a familial predisposition. 
                    Individuals with family members exhibiting these growths may have an increased likelihood of developing them as well. </p>
                <p>Moreover, seborrheic keratoses are more commonly observed in individuals over the age of 40, indicating an age-related occurrence. 
                    This suggests a potential connection between the development of these skin growths and the aging process, though the precise mechanisms 
                    are not fully understood.</p>
                <p>While sun exposure is associated with seborrheic keratosis, it is not considered a direct causative factor. These growths often appear on 
                    sun-exposed areas of the skin, implying a potential link to cumulative sun exposure over time. </p>

                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <p>Seborrheic keratoses are largely genetic and are associated with aging. As a result, there isn't a specific way to prevent their development. 
                    However, you can take general measures to promote overall skin health:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sun Protection: </strong> While seborrheic keratoses are not directly caused by sun exposure, protecting your skin from the sun can 
                        prevent other skin issues and reduce the risk of certain types of skin growths.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthy Lifestyle: </strong> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper skincare, can 
                        contribute to overall skin health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Skin Checks: </strong> Perform regular self-examinations of your skin to monitor for changes in existing 
                        lesions or the appearance of new growths. If you notice any concerning changes, seek professional evaluation.</li>
                </ul>
