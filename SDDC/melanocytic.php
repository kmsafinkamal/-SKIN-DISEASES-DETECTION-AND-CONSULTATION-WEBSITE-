            <p class="lead my-3">Melanocytic nevi are characterized by small, pigmented spots on the skin, often brown or black.
                While moles are common and usually harmless, it's essential to monitor them for changes in size, color, shape, or
                texture, as these changes could indicate skin cancer.</p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Melanocytic nevi manifest as small, pigmented spots on the skin, typically brown or black. These moles can vary
                    in size and shape. Regular monitoring is crucial, and any changes in size, color, shape, or texture should be
                    examined by a dermatologist, as they may indicate skin cancer.</p>

                
                <h2>Reasons</h2>
                <p>The development of moles is primarily influenced by genetic factors. Individuals with a family history of many
                    moles are more likely to develop them. Sun exposure, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation, is also a
                    significant factor, especially for those with fair skin.</p>
                <p>It's crucial to note that while most moles are benign, some may transform into melanoma, a form of skin cancer.
                    Regular skin checks and early detection are vital for identifying potential issues.</p>
                <p>If you have concerns about specific skin lesions or moles, it's recommended to consult with a dermatologist for
                    a professional evaluation and personalized advice.</p>

                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <p>While it's challenging to prevent the development of moles, especially with a genetic predisposition, there are
                    general tips for skin health:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Shield your skin from excessive sun exposure using high SPF sunscreen,
                        protective clothing, and seeking shade during peak sunlight hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Skin Checks:</strong> Conduct self-examinations regularly to monitor existing moles and
                        identify any changes. Consult a dermatologist if you notice unusual alterations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoiding Tanning Beds:</strong> Steer clear of tanning beds, as they can elevate the risk of skin
                        cancer, including melanoma.</li>
                </ul>
